NOTE: For Some Reason when i try to register user the API was giving me this error 'Note: Only defined users succeed registration' so i think they don't allow manual user registration,
Due to that i have to give the mock user registration which the site [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) provides, You can use those credentials for signup and signin.
